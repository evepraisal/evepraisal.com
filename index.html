		    <p>Evepraisal has been a really fun project for me. I think it has made a real impact with how Eve Online is played for many players. However, the time has come to shut it down.</p>
            <p>Recently, CCP has banned the IP address that I currently use to gather market data from Eve Online's ESI API. I started to work towards mitigating the issue by contacting support, but I stopped to think for a second about just... not. This may not surprise most people based on how nothing really changed with the website for years, but I haven't played Eve Online for several years now. As such, I've been mostly doing extremely rare maintenance on the tool. I have enough monitoring that usually I am alerted when something breaks (that's how I even know that CCP banned my IP from ESI) and I spend some time fixing it and then I move on with my life. However, I've become more and more out-of-touch with the game. It appears to be changing and it just feels weird running a tool for a game I don't have installed anywhere... for years...</p>
            <p><b>So I've decided to just pull the plug.</b> I'm sorry that advertisements may have been annoying but it essentially only made enough money to keep the site running. Thank you to everyone who has supported this project over the years. Eve Online has been a great game for many people for many years. I am happy to have had my role, however small, in shaping the game.</p>
